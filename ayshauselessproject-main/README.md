The “Malayali-ometer” is a hilariously useless web app that quizzes users on quirky Malayali traits and mini-games, spitting out random “Malayali Scores” with absurd cultural nonsense. It’s a playful celebration of Kerala’s vibe with zero accuracy guaranteed!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are losing sleep wondering if they’re “Malayali enough”—do they love coconut oil too much, or argue about fish curry with the right passion? This non-issue haunts their daily lives with unnecessary identity crises!

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We’ve crafted the “Malayali-ometer,” a ridiculous quiz and game fest where users dodge falling banana chips, sort sadya dishes like pros, and guess Mammootty movies—all to earn a random score and a fake certificate proving they’re 73% coconut tree! Because who needs real problems when you can have this nonsense?
