# Malayali-ometer  

Malayali-ometer is a hilariously useless web app built as part of **Useless Project 2.0 by Tinkerhub**.  
It quizzes users on quirky Malayali traits and mini-games, then gives a completely random “Malayali Score” filled with absurd cultural nonsense.  

This project is a playful celebration of Kerala’s vibe with zero accuracy guaranteed.  

## The Problem (that doesn’t exist)  
People wonder if they are “Malayali enough”—do they love coconut oil too much, or argue about fish curry with enough passion? This non-issue inspired us to create something truly pointless.  

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
Malayali-ometer lets users:  
- Dodge falling banana chips  
- Guess Mammootty movies  
- Answer random questions 
In the end, you get a nonsense score like “73% coconut tree” and a downloadable certificate to prove it.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS (Tailwind CSS)  
- **Framework:** React  
- **Libraries:** lucide-react, html2canvas, tailwindcss  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Malayali-omrter.git
   cd Malayali-omrter
